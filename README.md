# DHIS2 Group Project for IN5320 Development in Platforms and Ecosystems
This project was made over a six week period for the IN5320 Development in Platforms and Ecosystems course at the Institute of Informatics at UiO.

### Outlining Functionality
The application contains five pages. Three of these are dedicated to a specific task, whilst the remaining two act as overviews. The Dashboard is one of these, allowing you to access all pages and view the available commodities. All pages where it seems natural allow for searching and sorting.
- Replenishing Commodities

    The Replenish page is dedicated to the restocking/replenishment of commodities when a new order is received. It also acts as a secondary overview.
    
- Dispensing Commodities

    The Dispense page provides users with the ability to dispense a given quantity of all commodities at bulk (RQ9), selecting which user dispensed the commodities, which hospital personnel to dispense to (RQ4), and the given date (manual or automatic) of dispensing.

- Managing Personnel

    The Personnel page provides users with the ability to administer/manage the personnel which can be dispensed to. These personnel are persistent (RQ4). This page features an overview of personnel, allowing for the addition of new personnel, as well as the deletion of existing ones.
    
- Viewing Transactions

    Each replenishment and dispense order is saved as a transaction. These can be viewed on the Transaction page.
    
### Implementation

### Considerations
Although the application works as intended, there are a few things to remark on.
